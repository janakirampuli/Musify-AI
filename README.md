## General Information
- The Project mainly focusses on music from Piano instrument
- Uses Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) , a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- I found the concept of combining music and deep learning fascinating.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Technologies Used
- Platform: Visual Studio Code
- Python 
- TensorFlow
- Keras


## Project Status
Project is complete.


## Room for Improvement
Deep Learning has a wide range of applications in our daily life. The key steps in solving any problem are understanding the problem statement, formulating it and defining the architecture to solve the problem.

I had a lot of fun (and learning) while working on this project. Music is a passion of mine and it was quite intriguing combining deep learning with that.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by my passion in music
- This project was based on [this tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/01/how-to-perform-automatic-music-generation/).
- Many thanks to my mentor Abhijit Kumar.
